# Facial-Pattern-Recognition

The Kaggle dataset from the Facial Expression Recognition Challenge has been used for this project.

The following 2 models have been implemented:
1. Neural Network with 2 hidden-layers: Best error rate observed is 0.12 [ann_classifier.py]
2. Convolutional-Pooling combined with a fully connected neural network: Best error rate observed is 0.01 [cnn_classifier.py]
